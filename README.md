In the first figure, trajectory of distance between computed prices, demands and equilibrium prices, demands when dynamic_max_oracle_gd is run on randomly initialized dynamic linear, Cobb-Douglas, and Leontief Fisher markets, respectively, is depicted in blue. The dashed red line represents a convergence rate of 1/sqrt(T).

In the sencond figure, trajectory of distance between computed prices, demands and equilibrium prices, demands when dynamic_lgda is run on randomly initialized dynamic linear, Cobb-Douglas, and Leontief Fisher markets, respectively, is depicted in blue. The dashed red line represents a convergence rate of 1/sqrt(T).
In the sencond figure,
